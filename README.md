The Daily Goals Tracker is a simple and user-friendly website designed to help users stay productive by setting and managing their daily goals. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers features like adding goals with descriptions, and an interactive calendar to help users plan and visualize their tasks. The website's design and styling were entirely crafted by me using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean and accessible interface. For JavaScript, I referred to online resources to implement functionalities such as adding goals dynamically and storing them locally in the browser. While I made several attempts to integrate a mind map feature, I couldnâ€™t complete it in this project. However, this experience has inspired me to work on it in my future projects. This project reflects my efforts to create a practical and interactive tool for productivity, and I aim to enhance it further by adding features like a fully functional mind map, reminders, and progress analytics in the future.
